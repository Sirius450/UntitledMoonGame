  - Here, you'll find the messy abode of the domain's hardworking blacksmith.
  - 'Do not expect his services to be given easily though, for he is known to be
    quite greedy and often demands proof of your worthiness to wield his creations. '
  - Across his anvil, you will encounter a strange fellow only known as the Dream
    Weaver. He will help you weave your own dream catcher. Each strand added will
    give you a permanent upgrade.
