  - The gardner comfortably takes care of her plants in this very workshop.
  - 'The dreams and nightmares you''ll find yourself roaming are often host to the
    strangest species of flora. '
  - The Gardner will gladly take any specimen you bring back from your voyages to
    transform them into useful concoctions with the help of her brewer companion,
    who'se propensity to get lost in his head, aided by the fumes of some of the
    herbs surrounding him, makes him a rather semi reliable ally.
