  - You just got off the astral train and are now in the Moon Palace, the central
    hub of this game. Welcome to your new job!
  - It's not here right now, but at the center of this tiled floor will eventually
    rotate the ever brighter Crystal of Invocation, the link between realms. You'll
    be able to atune with it for mysterious purposes.
  - If you find yourself curious to know to basic controls of this game, head on
    over to Jimmy the parrot just north of me and he'll tell you all about it!
