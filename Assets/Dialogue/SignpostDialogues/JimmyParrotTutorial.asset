  - "Hey there little Pill Shaped Oddity, I'm Jimmy and my sole purpose in this world
    is to list the controls of the game for you\u2026 What a time to be alive!"
  - WASD is your movement, straight and simple. Hitting Shift while you move will
    allow you to dash in the same direction you're moving towards. The cursor of
    your mouse will determine the direction you are facing.
  - A click of the left mouse button will wack your sword. Hitting space will use
    a magic spell that, lucky for you, is currently unlimited. You can always hit
    P to pause the game and go the main menu.
